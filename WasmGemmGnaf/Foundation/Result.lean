# Foundation: the result algebra (SPEC §6.1)

Every result type here is *closed* and *payload bearing*: no outcome is a bare
tag, and every failure names the structural object it is about.

## The `optimal` constructor

SPEC §6.1: "No constructor named `optimal` may be created without an exact
global certificate whose verifier reconstructs the final proposition."

`GlobalCertificate value` is therefore an index-carrying structure holding only
the *verifiable syntactic* components of such a certificate — schema, scope
identities, the candidate identity together with a proof that it really is the
identity of `value`, the replayable partition/coverage roots, and the scores.

It deliberately carries **no** field of the form `IsGlobalOptimal value`.  The
project rules forbid storing a theorem's conclusion as an unproved structure
field, and the release-level optimality proposition is not available in the
Foundation layer.  Consequently this file provides no smart constructor that
manufactures a certificate: a `GlobalCertificate` can only be assembled by
supplying every syntactic component, and `candidate_eq` — the one link that
cannot be faked — must be discharged by the caller.
