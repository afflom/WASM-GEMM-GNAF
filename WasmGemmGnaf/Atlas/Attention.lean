# Atlas: attention (SPEC §12.2)

SPEC §12.2 requires `Atlas.attend : StateBody → RequestSignature →
CanonicalSet CanonicalObjectId` to be "an exact work-routing mechanism" over
canonical applicability signatures.

This file supplies it as a *real, total, decidable* function: `attend` is a
structurally recursive computation over the recorded attention index, it
terminates on every input, and its result is a `CanonicalSet` — a duplicate-free
list whose `Nodup` proof is produced by the construction (`dedupIds_nodup`), not
assumed.

## Proved

* `Atlas.attend_deterministic` — attention is a function of the recorded index
  and the request alone.
* `Atlas.attend_mem_iff` — exact characterisation of the routed set.
* `Atlas.attend_subset_indexTargets`, `Atlas.attend_subset_objects` — the result
  is a subset of the objects the state records (the latter under the state's own
  well-formedness condition, which is decidable and provably equivalent to the
  side condition already checked by `Atlas.attentionCompleteCheck`).
* `Atlas.attend_monotone` — widening the request can only add routed objects.

## Omitted, deliberately — and now REFUTED

`attention_no_optimum_relevant_false_negative` (SPEC §12.2) is **not** in this
repository, and the reason is no longer that it could not be stated: it is that
it is **false**.  `Atlas/AttentionCoverage.lean` proves it false — parametrically
in the two predicates SPEC names but does not define
(`Atlas.attention_no_optimum_relevant_false_negative_is_false`), with a witness
that is a fully sealed state (`Atlas.sealCertificateAt`, all seven deterministic
checkers discharged) whose attention root indexes nothing, against a candidate
that really is `Universal.ProfileValid`, really carries a
`Universal.SystemEvaluation`, and really scores at the core's baseline
(`Atlas.undeclared_witness_is_missed`).  `DEV-005` in
`model/spec-deviations.json` files it.

Its content is the undischarged universal coverage obligation of SPEC §10.5 —
the same obligation `Atlas/CoverageScope.lean` proves the seal's cover check
cannot supply.  The intended content, under the one hypothesis that gap consists
of, is `Atlas.attention_no_declared_optimum_relevant_false_negative`.

## Anti-vacuity (UOR-GNAF §18: index presence proves nothing)

`Atlas.attend_blind_to_optimizer_state` proves that `attend` is determined by
the recorded attention index alone: two states whose indexes agree route
identically no matter how their candidate facts, cost surfaces, partitions,
envelope, or certificates differ.  Therefore "object `x` is in
`attend s request`" carries **no** information about optimality, feasibility, or
cost of `x`; it says only that some indexer wrote `x` under a matching
signature.

/--
**Scope blindness of attention.**

`attend` is a function of exactly two things: the recorded `attentionIndex` and
the request.  Two states that agree on the index route identically — whatever
their candidate facts, cost surfaces, search partitions, lower envelope or
certificate store say.

Consequence, and the reason this lemma is here: no proposition about optimality,
feasibility or cost can be derived from `CanonicalSet.Mem (attend s r) x`.  The
membership records that an indexer wrote `x` under a matching signature, which
is exactly the situation UOR-GNAF §18 lists as an explicit non-claim:

  *that registration, discovery, index presence, or provenance alone proves
  eligibility, correctness, trust, feasibility, cost, or optimality.*

SPEC §12.2 says the same in one line: "An attention score alone is never an
optimality proof."
