  Wasm/Costed.lean --- cost instrumentation for the legacy subset machine.

  SCOPE.  Every relation in this file is built over the legacy `Wasm.Config`,
  `Wasm.Step`, and `Wasm.Event` of `Wasm/Run.lean`.  The laws below
  prove exact instrumentation for that machine; they are not a cost semantics
  for the public amended-Core execution layer and do not establish full
  SPEC section 7.5 rule coverage.

  Normative source: SPEC.md section 7.5, which requires that every semantic
  transition be labelled with exact abstract cost events, and fixes the total
  contribution law:

      every relational step contributes one `wasmRuleSteps` unit;
      `dispatchSteps` additionally counts exactly branch, branch-table, direct
      or indirect call, return, exception transfer, tail-call transfer, and
      harness phase-transition rule identifiers; `scalarOps` is the number of
      scalar primitive numeric operations performed by the rule; `vectorLaneOps`
      is the exact number of active 128-bit lanes operated on, with a
      whole-vector shuffle contributing 16 byte lanes; each
      load/store/table/data/memory event contributes its exact accessed or
      allocated byte, page, or element count; failed or trapping accesses
      contribute the attempted rule step but no completed transfer; ...
      `peakStackValues`, `peakPages`, and every other peak are maxima over the
      complete costed configuration sequence, while all nonpeak coordinates are
      sums.

  Three design decisions carry the anti-cheat weight of this file.

  * A costed event is *computed from the source configuration*, never supplied.
    `label : Config → Event → Option CostedEvent` reads the pending instruction,
    the control stack, the operand stack and the harness descriptor, and
    `CostedStep c ce c'` holds only when `label c ce.erase = some ce`.  A
    competitor therefore cannot pair a real transition with a cheaper label:
    the installed-byte count of the harness entry rule, for instance, is
    `c.harness.rawBytes.length` by construction.  `label` is `Option`-valued
    with `none` on every combination it does not recognise, so a reduction rule
    added later without a cost row has *no* costed step at all rather than a
    silently free one.

  * `EventContribution` is an inductive relation with exactly one constructor
    per `CostedEvent` constructor and **no default arm**, so
    `wasm_cost_table_total` is a real totality-and-exclusivity statement: adding
    a costed event without deciding its charge breaks the proof.

  * The three peak coordinates are contributed by the *configuration snapshots*
    only, and the snapshots are pinned structurally by `CostedReduces` to the
    configurations actually visited.  A costed trace cannot understate a peak.

  Every declaration in this file is proved.  Nothing is assumed.

/-! ## Event determinism

The costed layer needs one property of the plain machine that `Wasm/Step.lean`
does not state: a configuration and an event determine the successor.  It is
read off the successor enumerator, whose *keys* are duplicate free —
`memory.grow` really does branch, but its two successors carry the two distinct
outcome labels. -/

operand values of its own.  The values it will resume with are exactly the ones

/-! ## The canonical declarative-validation derivation size (SPEC section 7.5)

`CostTableBody.validationCost` charges one unit per node and one per premise
edge of the canonical declarative-validation derivation, but takes the node and
edge counts as numbers.  This section computes them from the module, so that
the charge is a function of the artifact rather than of an oracle.

The derivation counted is the one `Wasm.DeclarativelyValid` is: a root node
with a premise edge to each of the five closed conditions (`checkClosed`,
`checkMems`, `exportsMemory`, `checkGemmExport`, `checkStart`), one to each
global's validity node, one to each tag's validity node and one to each
function's validity node; and every function node has one premise edge to the
root of its body's `Wasm.ExprTyping` derivation.  The `ExprTyping` and
`InstrTyping` node and edge counts below are read directly off the constructors
of those two mutual inductives: `ExprTyping.nil` is a leaf, `ExprTyping.cons`
has two premises, `InstrTyping.block` and `InstrTyping.loop` have one, and
`InstrTyping.ifThenElse` has two. -/

mutual

/-- Nodes of the canonical `Wasm.InstrTyping` derivation of one instruction.

Every structured control instruction recurses into its body, including
`try_table`, which `Wasm.InstrTyping` does not admit: counting its body keeps
the number an upper bound on the derivation of any extension of the subset
rather than a number that would shrink when the subset grows.  Every other
instruction outside the declared subset has no derivation at all and is counted
as the single (failing) leaf node the derivation attempt occupies.  The
function is therefore total on the whole syntax, valid or not. -/
