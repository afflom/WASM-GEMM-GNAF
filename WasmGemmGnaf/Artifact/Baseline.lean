  Artifact/Baseline.lean --- the concrete baseline byte sequence, and exactly
  how far obligation GO-006 (nonemptiness) actually goes.

  Normative sources: SPEC.md sections 7.2/7.3 (the release profile and the
  release validator), 8.3/8.4 (the raw invocation carrier and the reference
  acceptance relation), 10.1 (`Universal.ProfileValid`,
  `Universal.SemanticCorrect`, `Universal.SemanticWithinResources`) and 13
  (Phase B / Phase D).

  ## GO-006, STATED

  `Universal.Admissible` is a conjunction of three extensional predicates, and
  the attainability argument of SPEC §13 Phase D needs one byte sequence
  satisfying all three *plus* an inhabitant of `Universal.SystemEvaluation`:

    (a) `Universal.ProfileValid Release.wasmProfile b`
    (b) `Universal.SemanticCorrect (Release.setting seam) b`
    (c) `Universal.SemanticWithinResources (Release.setting seam) b`
    (d) `Universal.SystemEvaluation (Release.setting seam) b`

  ## WHAT THIS FILE PROVES: (a), ON A CONCRETE LITERAL

  `Artifact.baselineBytes` is a closed term of type `ByteArray`: the canonical
  encoding of the module the GNAF compiler emits from `GNAF.gemmWitnessChecked`,
  the `1x1x1` modular-`u32` GEMM plan of `GNAF/CompileCorrect.lean`.  It is not
  a parameter, not a `Classical.choice`, and not an opaque constant.

  **`Artifact.baseline_profileValid`** proves conjunct (a) for it, outright and
  with no hypothesis:

  * `Wasm.decode baselineBytes = .ok baselineModule` — `Artifact.decode_emit`,
    which is `Wasm.encode_decode_roundtrip`;
  * `Universal.validateUnder Release.wasmProfile baselineModule = true` — the
    release validator from `GNAF.gemmWitness_compiles`, and the profile's
    first-order limit table by `decide` (every count in the emitted module is
    `0`, `1` or `2`, and every release limit is `2 ^ 32 - 1`);
  * `baselineModule.imports = []` — definitionally, `GNAF.moduleOf` declares no
    import;
  * `Universal.HasExactGemmExports` — the memory export and the pinned-ABI
    `gemm` export are *conjuncts of `Wasm.validate` itself*, so they are read
    straight out of `GNAF.gemmWitness_compiles`, and the emitted export list is
    literally the two-element list `[gemm, memory]`, so no third export exists.

  Nothing here is assumed and nothing is decided by `native_decide`.

  ## WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PROVE, AND WHY: (b), (c), (d)

  **GO-006 REMAINS OPEN.**  It is not discharged here, it is not discharged
  anywhere in this repository, and no theorem below may be cited as if it were.

  ### (b) `SemanticCorrect` — out of reach, and the obstruction is named

  `Universal.SemanticCorrect S b` unfolds to: for **every** raw invocation
  `raw : Gemm.RawInvocation Release.wasmProfile`, (i) some maximal execution of
  the costed initial configuration exists, and (ii) **every** maximal execution
  of it has a finite observation accepted by `Gemm.Reference.Accepts`.  And
  `Gemm.Reference.Accepts` is byte-exact: `Gemm.ReferenceSemanticAccepts`
  requires the outcome to be `.returned` with the reference status, with the
  entry store equal to `Gemm.entryObservable` at *every* index and the final
  store equal to `Gemm.referenceObservableStore` at *every* index, and the
  second conjunct additionally confines every candidate memory write to the
  sanctioned regions.

  Proving that for `baselineModule` is exactly SPEC §11.4's **`compile_refines`**,
  which `GNAF/CompileCorrect.lean` records as **omitted** under `BI-002`/`O-6`
  and explains at length: the GNAF machine of `GNAF/Semantics.lean` computes
  over unbounded `Nat` cells while the Wasm machine computes over `i32`, so the
  refinement statement is *false* as written without an explicit boundedness
  precondition and an explicit representation relation between a `GNAF.Machine`
  and a `Wasm.Config`; and the bounded version needs a simulation argument for
  every plan constructor, which exists nowhere here.  On top of that,
  `GNAF/CompileCorrect.lean` itself records that the witness plan is the
  `alpha = 1`, `beta = 0`, `1x1x1` instance and that its cell image is *not*
  proved to coincide with the byte image of `Gemm/ABI.lean` — so even a
  finished `compile_refines` would not immediately give `Accepts` over the whole
  raw-invocation domain.

  What it would take, concretely and in order: a representation relation between
  `GNAF.Machine` and `Wasm.Config`; a boundedness invariant discharging the
  `Nat`-versus-`i32` gap; a per-constructor simulation lemma for `GNAF.code`;
  the ABI bridge identifying `GNAF.gemmWitnessMem` with `Gemm.encodeHeader`'s
  byte image; and then, over *every* raw invocation rather than the classified
  ones, agreement with `Gemm.referenceObservableStore` — including the
  descriptor-invalid, unsupported and resource-exhausted branches.  None of the
  five exists.

  It is therefore **not** stated below, not as a theorem, not as a hypothesis of
  a theorem that concludes `Universal.Admissible`, and not inside any structure
  field.  The one theorem that used to take it as an explicit named premise,
  `Artifact.exists_globalOptimal_of_baseline_semantics`, is deleted: its
  conclusion was indexed by `Release.decider`.

  ### (c) `SemanticWithinResources` — not even expressible yet

  It quantifies over `Release.Seam.machine`'s costed observations and compares
  against `Release.Seam.limit`.  Both are parameters of `Release.Seam`: SPEC
  §7.5's costed semantics and SPEC §10.1's costed machine do not exist in this
  repository (`Artifact/Release.lean`, header items 2 and 3), and SPEC §8.2's
  six-field resource contract determines only six of `Cost.DynamicVector`'s
  sixteen coordinates (item 4).  With `seam` universally quantified, (c) is
  simply false for some seams — e.g. any seam whose limit vector is zero — so
  no unconditional theorem about it can exist here, and manufacturing a
  favourable seam would be choosing the resource contract to fit the artifact.

  ### (d) `SystemEvaluation` — blocked on the same seam

  `Universal.InputEvaluation.treeComplete` needs
  `seam.machine.exploreAllCosted` to answer `.complete` with a
  `Foundation.NonemptyCanonicalFrontier`.  `Wasm/Fuel.lean` supplies only the
  uncosted, unordered, possibly empty `Wasm.exploreAll`.  It also needs
  `[Foundation.Fintype (Gemm.RawInvocation Release.wasmProfile)]`, which is
  recorded **omitted** under `O-3`.

  ## WHAT ELSE IS PROVED: the honest partial results

  Everything about `baselineBytes` that is a *bytes-side* obligation is
  discharged, so that what remains is isolated on the machine side:

  * `Artifact.baseline_startsCostedInvocation_iff` — for the baseline bytes,
    `Universal.StartsCostedInvocation` is **equivalent** to a statement about
    `seam.machine` alone.  The decode conjunct and the `validateUnder` conjunct
    of `StartsCostedInvocation` are gone: they are theorems, not obligations.
  * `Artifact.systemEvaluation_module_eq` — every system evaluation of the
    baseline bytes evaluates exactly `baselineModule`; the decoder leaves no
    freedom.
  * `Artifact.baseline_admissible_iff` — `Universal.Admissible` at the baseline
    bytes is equivalent to conjuncts (b) and (c) alone.  This is the precise
    sense in which conjunct (a) of GO-006 is closed.

  `Classical.choice` is not used in this file at all: the reduction theorem that
  used to pull it in through `Release.decider` is deleted along with that
  evaluator (`Artifact/Release.lean` §3).  There is no `sorry`, no `admit`, no
  project axiom, no `native_decide`, no `unsafe` and no `partial`.

  ## THE DISCLOSED PROFILE DEVIATION IS INHERITED

  `Release.wasmProfile` is `Wasm.unitWitnessProfile`, not SPEC §7.2's release
  literal: its cost table carries no rule rows.  Every statement below is at
  that profile and inherits the disclosure made in `Artifact/Release.lean`.
  The deviation is confined to the cost table, and `Universal.ProfileValid`
  reads only `P.body.limits`, so `Artifact.baseline_profileValid` would survive
  the substitution of the real release cost table unchanged.

  **The bytes-side of `StartsCostedInvocation`, discharged.**

  For the baseline bytes, SPEC §10.1's `Universal.StartsCostedInvocation` is
  *equivalent* to a statement about `seam.machine` alone: its decode conjunct
  and its `validateUnder` conjunct are theorems (`baseline_decode`,
  `baseline_validateUnder`), and its module is forced to be `baselineModule`.

  This is the sharpest thing that can be said about conjuncts (b) and (c)
  without the costed machine: it does not prove that the machine initializes,
  and it does not prove anything whatever about what happens after it does.

  **Exactly what is left of GO-006 at the baseline bytes.**

  `Universal.Admissible` at `baselineBytes` is equivalent to conjuncts (b) and
  (c) alone.  Conjunct (a) has been removed from the obligation, not assumed
  into it.

concluded `Universal.GlobalOptimal … (Release.decider seam) …` from conjuncts
(b), (c) and (d) supplied by the caller, and `Release.decider` — the
`noncomputable` `Classical.choice` evaluator — has been deleted as a
non-conforming discharge of UV-003.  The theorem is deleted with it, and no
weaker or renamed form replaces it: with no implemented `Universal.Decider` at
the release scope there is no `Universal.GlobalOptimal` statement to make about
the baseline bytes.

What this file still proves is unaffected, because none of it mentions a
decider: `Artifact.baseline_profileValid` (conjunct (a) on a closed literal),
`Artifact.systemEvaluation_module_eq`, and `Artifact.baseline_admissible_iff`,
which reduces `Universal.Admissible` at `Artifact.baselineBytes` to conjuncts
(b) and (c) alone.  **GO-006 is open.** -/
