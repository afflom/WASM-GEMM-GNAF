  Coverage scope: what the seal's cover check does and does not establish.

  This file exists to HARDEN the repository, not to weaken it.  SPEC §12.1 lets
  `Atlas.SealCertificate` record the result of a deterministic cover checker, and
  SPEC §15 separately requires `Atlas.seal_implies_universal_coverage`.  Those are
  two different propositions, and conflating them is the single most attractive way
  to make this repository *appear* to prove global optimality.

  The lemma below makes the distinction machine-checked: it proves that
  `universalCoverCompleteCheck` is blind to the byte universe.  A latent gap that
  only a careful reader would notice becomes a fact the kernel has verified.

**Scope blindness of the cover check.**

`universalCoverCompleteCheck` is a function of exactly three recorded components:
the state's `searchPartitions`, the identities in its `candidateFacts`, and the
core's `partitionCoverRoot`.  Two states agreeing on those three agree on the
check — *whatever* byte strings exist, decode, validate, or compute GEMM.

The check verifies only that the recorded cover is internally consistent with
the recorded candidate facts. It does not inspect `ByteArray`, decode modules,
or establish that those partitions denote every profile-valid byte string. The
equality theorem below records that scope limitation; it is not a meta-level
proof that no byte-quantified proposition could follow from additional premises.

This is exactly the failure mode SPEC §10.5 forbids when it requires
`universal_sublevel_coverage` to "have no coverage hypothesis", and that
UOR-GNAF §18 lists as an explicit non-claim:

  *that registration, discovery, index presence, or provenance alone proves
  eligibility, correctness, trust, feasibility, cost, or optimality.*

`Atlas.seal_implies_universal_coverage` (SPEC §15) is therefore absent rather
than being inferred from this bookkeeping check. A future proof must supply the
separate public-carrier coverage premises.

The same equality with a fixed state: the cover check cannot distinguish two
cores whose recorded roots agree. This is scope evidence, not the missing
all-competitor coverage theorem.
