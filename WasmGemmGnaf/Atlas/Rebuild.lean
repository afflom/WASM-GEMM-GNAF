# Atlas: full rebuild and rebuild equivalence (SPEC §12.5)

`Atlas.semanticRebuildBody` derives the complete state body from a declaration
base and nothing else.  SPEC §12.5 is explicit that this is the point:
"`contents` is exactly `state.body.declarationBase`, so rebuild equivalence has
no ambient input."

## Two consequences of "no ambient input"

1. **The accumulated delta root must be derivable.**  It is: see
   `Atlas.accumulatedDeltaRootOf` in `Atlas/Update.lean`.

2. **The scope identities cannot be recovered from the declarations.**  A
   declaration base does not name its own profile, problem or objective, so
   `semanticRebuildBody` — whose only input is the declaration base — must
   choose them.  It uses `Atlas.Scope.unscoped`.

   Both forms of the rebuild theorem are therefore proved:

   * `Atlas.incremental_eq_full_rebuild_scoped` — the general statement, for a
     rebuild carried out in the state's own scope.  This is the one to use.
   * `Atlas.incremental_eq_full_rebuild` — SPEC §12.5's literal statement,
     which additionally requires the state to be in the unscoped scope, because
     otherwise the two sides genuinely disagree on the three scope identities
     and the equation is false.  Stating it without that hypothesis would be a
     false theorem, so the hypothesis is stated rather than hidden.

Both require `Atlas.Coherent state.body`: a state whose recorded semantic half
is not the one its declarations derive cannot equal any rebuild, and
`Atlas.rebuild_coherent` / `Atlas.semanticApplyBody_coherent` show the
hypothesis is preserved by exactly the operations that produce states.

## Neither hypothesis is a convenience

SPEC §12.5's literal statement quantifies over every `Atlas.UnsealedState`, and
that type carries neither a scope nor a coherence obligation.  Both extra
hypotheses are therefore refuted-if-dropped rather than merely convenient, and
both refutations are proved below rather than asserted:

* `Atlas.incremental_ne_full_rebuild_of_objectiveId` — for *every* budget and
  delta, a state whose objective identity is not `nullId` makes SPEC's equation
  false, because `semanticApplyBody` preserves the scope and
  `semanticRebuildBody` can only produce `Scope.unscoped`;
* `Atlas.not_incremental_eq_full_rebuild_unscoped` — supplying
  `state.body.scope = Scope.unscoped` as a hypothesis does not rescue the
  statement: a concrete unscoped state that records one semantic object its
  empty declaration base does not derive falsifies it for the empty delta.
  (This shows that dropping `hcoherent` is not free.  It does not show
  `hcoherent` is the weakest sufficient hypothesis: `canonicalize` is a normal
  form, so a body differing from its derivation only by order or repetition
  would still satisfy the equation.)

`Atlas.not_incremental_eq_full_rebuild` is the resulting refutation of the
literal statement.  This is deviation `DEV-004` of `model/spec-deviations.json`.

here: each one is evaluated on the rebuilt state against the core the rebuild

non-vacuous — there really are sealed states to query.

The rebuilt state has an **empty optimizer half**, so the cover, envelope and
certificate-store checks pass over empty records.  That is a fact about the
rebuild, not a claim of optimality: see
