  Wasm/Fuel.lean --- the bounded all-branch execution-tree explorer.

  Normative source: SPEC.md section 7.4:

      The executable object is a bounded execution-tree explorer, not a one-path
      interpreter ... Soundness SHALL map every returned observation to a
      relational execution.  Completeness SHALL prove that every relational
      branch of length at most the bound occurs in the tree, and that `complete`
      contains every maximal branch.  `nonterminalPrefix` proves the module
      cannot satisfy a smaller all-branch step sublevel.  Completeness is
      relative to an explicit bound ... No general halting oracle is permitted.

  Scope disclosure: this file explores the legacy `Wasm.Subset` machine
  (`Config`, `Event`, and `successors`), not the public amended-Core execution
  semantics required by SPEC §7.4.  The theorem names below are proved for that
  legacy carrier and therefore do not discharge the corresponding public
  release obligations.

  `exploreTree` recurses over *every* element of `successors`, so a
  configuration with two permitted `memory.grow` outcomes contributes both
  subtrees.  The three required theorems are proved:

      Wasm.runFuel_sound
      Wasm.runFuel_complete_with_bound
      Wasm.bounded_tree_covers_every_branch

  The third is the "and that `complete` contains every maximal branch" clause,
  and it carries NO hypothesis on the trace length.  It is not a restatement of
  `runFuel_complete_with_bound`: the `complete` constructor is reachable only
  when `prefixes (bound + 1) [] initial = []`, and `prefixes_complete` (proved
  here, the converse of `prefixes_sound`) turns that into a proof that every
  finite execution of that particular `initial` has a trace of length at most
  `bound + 1`.  On a `nonterminalPrefix` result the unconditional statement is
  false, so the `complete` hypothesis is load bearing.

  Deviation from the SPEC signature, disclosed: SPEC's `complete` constructor
  carries a `NonemptyCanonicalList`, and its `nonterminalPrefix` constructor
  carries only a trace.  Here `complete` carries a plain list (the legacy subset
  machine admits stuck configurations, for which the observation list of a
  subtree is genuinely empty) and `nonterminalPrefix` additionally carries the
  observations found so far together with their coverage proof.  Without the
  latter, `runFuel_complete_with_bound` would be *false*: one branch may
  terminate inside the bound while another is still running past it.

  Every declaration in this file is proved.  Nothing is assumed.
