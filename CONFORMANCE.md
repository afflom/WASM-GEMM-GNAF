Permitted: `propext`, `Quot.sound`, `Classical.choice` (Lean core logical
axioms, SPEC 4). Any `sorryAx` or project-declared axiom fails the gate.

## Refuted framings

Recorded so they are not silently re-asserted:

- **REFUTED** (high) — Closure requires the exact tensor rank of <3,3,3> (open, 19<=R<=23).
  - Multiplications and additions are both charged at weight one, so rank is not the binding quantity. Laderman's 23-mult 3x3 scheme costs 23+98=121 charged ops vs naive 45. Truth value invariant across [19,23].
- **REFUTED** (medium) — Closure requires exact minimal-program-size lower bounds, an open circuit-complexity problem.
  - Weight-one module bytes creates a minimal-total-cost obligation, not a minimal-program-size one; asymptotic circuit lower bounds are the wrong authority.
- **REFUTED** (high) — SPEC 10.3's 'finite and exactly enumerable' is false at release scale.
  - As literally written it is provable with no computation: a subset of a finite type is finite. The magnitudes are irrelevant to a finiteness claim.
