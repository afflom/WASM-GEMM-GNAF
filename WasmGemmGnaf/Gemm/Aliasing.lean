# Gemm: byte ranges and the alias contract (SPEC §8.3)

> Aliasing tags are `disjoint = 0`, `cMayAliasAAfterRead = 1`, and
> `cMayAliasBAfterRead = 2`.
>
> A and B are read-only and may overlap each other. `disjoint` requires C to be
> disjoint from both. `cMayAliasAAfterRead` permits overlap only with A and
> defines the result against an immutable logical snapshot of A taken before the
> first C write; `cMayAliasBAfterRead` is symmetric. … **No tag permits C to
> overlap both A and B.**
>
> The header, scratch, and status-detail ranges are pairwise disjoint and each
> is disjoint from A, B, and C. … Any other overlap is `invalid` at the
> alias-validation precedence step.

`no_tag_permits_both` is proved from the table rather than asserted, and the
"overlapping byte count" that SPEC §8.3 feeds into the status-detail record is
the explicit `ByteRange.overlapCount` defined here.
