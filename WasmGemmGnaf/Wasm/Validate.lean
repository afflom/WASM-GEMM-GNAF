  Wasm/Validate.lean --- the declarative typing judgment and its decidable
  checker.

  Normative source: SPEC.md section 7.1 ("`Validate` owns all context and
  declaration judgments"), section 7.2 ("disabled forms decode when
  grammatically valid and then fail profile validation") and section 7.3, which
  requires

      theorem validate_bool_iff (module : Wasm.Module) :
        Wasm.validate module = true ↔ Wasm.DeclarativelyValid module

  `Wasm/Syntax.lean` expresses the whole pinned Core 3.0 grammar, so every
  Core form can be *written*.  Validation is what selects the released
  executable subset: an instruction outside the declared subset has no typing
  rule, hence no derivation, hence `validate` rejects it.  That is exactly the
  behaviour SPEC section 7.2 prescribes for out-of-profile forms, and it is the
  reason the judgment below is stated positively (rules only for admitted
  forms) rather than by a list of prohibitions.

  The declared executable subset is: `unreachable`, `nop`, `i32.const`, `drop`,
  the wrapping and unsigned `i32` binary operators, `i32.eqz`, the `i32`
  relational operators, the local and global accessors, full-width `i32`
  loads/stores on memory 0, `memory.size`/`memory.grow` on memory 0, the
  structured control forms `block`, `loop` and `if` with empty block type,
  `br`/`br_if`, and `throw`.  Every other Core form --- SIMD, GC, reference,
  table, bulk-memory, tail-call, `try_table`, 64-bit and floating point --- is
  grammatically expressible and is rejected here.

  ## Correspondence with the vendored Core 3.0 validation rules

  The vendored normative text is `vendor/wasm-spec/document/core/valid/`.  Two
  things about that text govern what can be checked against it here.

  1. In the vendored tree the *bodies* of the typing rules are SpecTec macro
     references --- `valid/instructions.rst` writes `${rule: Instr_ok/load-val}`
     and `valid/modules.rst` writes `${rule: Module_ok}` --- and the `.watsup`
     sources those expand from are not part of the vendored snapshot.  What the
     snapshot does state in full is: the prose of `valid/conventions.rst`
     (contexts, the label stack, polymorphism), the notes of
     `valid/instructions.rst`, and --- decisively --- the complete
     sound-and-complete type-checking algorithm of
     `vendor/wasm-spec/document/core/appendix/algorithm.rst`, which
     `valid/conventions.rst` ("Conventions") names as the algorithmic
     counterpart of the declarative rules.  Every correspondence claimed below
     is to text that is literally present in the snapshot.

  2. `valid/conventions.rst` ("Contexts") fixes the shape of the context:
     *Labels* are "the stack of labels accessible from the current position,
     represented by their result type".  The judgment below therefore records a
     label as its result *arity*; since every value of the subset is an `i32`,
     an arity is a complete result type.

  The judgment is stated frame-relative, exactly as
  `appendix/algorithm.rst` prescribes.  There, `push_ctrl` records
  `val_height := vals.size()` on entering a block, `pop_val` raises an error
  when `vals.size() = ctrls[0].val_height` --- so a block may not consume
  operands pushed before it was entered --- and `pop_ctrl` requires
  `vals.size() = frame.val_height` after the block's results are popped.  Here
  a block body is typed at height `0` and must return to `0`, so `Nat` itself
  is the underflow check: the frame floor is structurally unreachable.  This is
  what the earlier revision of this file got wrong: it typed a block body at
  the *enclosing absolute* height, which admitted

      i32.const 0 ; block (drop ; i32.const 0) ; drop

  --- a module that Core validation rejects, because the `drop` inside the
  block underflows the block's frame.

  Instruction by instruction, and citing `appendix/algorithm.rst`'s
  `func validate(opcode)` unless noted:

  * `nop`, `i32.const`, `drop`, the `i32` binary/test/relational operators ---
    the `i32.add` and `drop` cases; `drop` is value-polymorphic
    (`valid/instructions.rst`, note under `_valid-drop`) but every subset value
    is `i32`, so a height is a type.
  * `local.get`/`local.set`/`local.tee` --- the `local.get x`/`local.set x`
    cases.  Core's initialization tracking (`locals_init`) is vacuous here:
    `i32` is defaultable, so `get_local` never fails.
  * `global.get`/`global.set` --- `valid/instructions.rst` `_valid-global.get`
    / `_valid-global.set`; the premises are `C.globals[x] = mut t` and, for
    `global.set`, that the mutability is `var`.
  * `t.load` / `t.store` --- `valid/instructions.rst` `_valid-load-val` /
    `_valid-store-val`.  Two premises: the memory index must name a declared
    memory (here memory `0`, and `Module.checkMems` declares exactly one), and
    the alignment must not exceed the access width, `2 ^ memarg.align <= |t|/8`.
    For full-width `i32` that is `2 ^ align <= 4`, i.e. `align <= 2`; see
    `alignOk_iff_pow_le`.  `syntax/instructions.rst` ("Memory Instructions")
    fixes `align` as the exponent of a power of two.
  * `memory.size` / `memory.grow` --- `valid/instructions.rst`
    `_valid-memory.size` / `_valid-memory.grow`, on the single declared memory.
  * `block` / `loop` / `if` --- the `block`/`loop`/`if`/`end`/`else` cases, with
    the frame discipline described above.  Only the empty block type is
    admitted, so `Blocktype_ok` (`valid/types.rst`, "Block Types") is the
    trivial instance and both `label_types` alternatives (start types for
    `loop`, end types for `block`/`if`) are the empty result type.
  * `br` / `br_if` --- the `br n` / `br_if n` cases, together with the note
    under `valid/instructions.rst` `_valid-br` that the label index space
    "contains the most recent label first".
  * `throw` --- the `throw x` case; `Module.checkTag` pins every declared tag to
    `[i32] -> []`, so popping one operand is popping `tags[x].type.params`.
  * function bodies --- `valid/modules.rst` ("Functions"), plus
    `appendix/algorithm.rst`: "every function has an implicit outermost label
    that corresponds to an implicit block frame".  `Module.funcCtx` therefore
    seeds the label stack with the function's own result arity.

  ## What is deliberately *not* modelled

  The judgment below is a **sound restriction** of Core 3.0 validation, not an
  equivalent of it.  Two kinds of gap, both intentional:

  * **Excluded families.**  SIMD/vector, GC (structures, arrays, `i31`),
    reference types and `ref.*`, tables and element segments, bulk memory and
    data segments, tail calls (`return_call`, `return_call_indirect`),
    exception handling beyond a bare `throw` (`try_table`, `throw_ref`),
    `call`/`call_indirect`/`return`, `br_table`, `select`, non-empty block
    types, `i64`, `f32` and `f64`.  These are expressible in `Wasm/Syntax.lean`
    and have no rule here, so they are rejected --- which is what SPEC section
    7.2 prescribes for out-of-profile forms.
  * **Stack polymorphism.**  `valid/instructions.rst` (`_polymorphism`, and the
    notes under `_valid-unreachable` and `_valid-br`) makes `unreachable`, `br`
    and `throw` stack-polymorphic: `appendix/algorithm.rst`'s `unreachable()`
    purges the frame's operands and sets a flag under which `pop_val` yields
    `Bot`.  The rules below instead type those three instructions concretely
    (`h -> h`, `h -> h` at a label of arity `h`, and `h+1 -> h`), which
    *rejects* code Core accepts, for example `(unreachable) (i32.add)` or a
    `br` taken with operands still below the label's results.  The judgment is
    therefore contained in Core validation, never wider than it.

  Consequently `Wasm.validate_iff_declarative` is an equivalence between the
  executable validator and the declarative judgment **for the modelled
  subset**, and a one-way soundness statement with respect to full Core 3.0.

  Every declaration in this file is proved.  Nothing is assumed.

/-! ## Validation contexts -/

/-- A validation context: the number of locals in scope, the declared global
types, the number of declared tags, and the result arity of each label
currently in scope (innermost first).

This is the fragment of the Core context of
`vendor/wasm-spec/document/core/valid/conventions.rst` ("Contexts") that the
released subset can use: *Locals* (all `i32`, so only their number matters),
*Globals*, *Tags* and *Labels*.  The remaining fields of the Core context ---
*Types*, *Recursive Types*, *Functions*, *Tables*, *Memories*, *Element
Segments*, *Data Segments*, *Return* and *References* --- are either fixed by
the profile (exactly one memory, no tables, no segments) or belong to families
this judgment does not admit. -/

what the checker tests.  Stating it on the exponent matters: `2 ^ align` for a
decoded 32-bit `align` is not something a decision procedure should build. -/

`InstrTyping C h i h'` says that in context `C` the instruction `i` takes an

declared subset is an `i32`, a height is a complete stack type. -/

`valid/modules.rst` ("Types") requires the module's whole type section to be
valid, not merely the entries some function happens to name: `Module_ok` has
`Types_ok` as a premise, and `Types_ok` validates the sequence of declared
types incrementally.  The condition below is a *restriction* of `Subtype_ok`
(`valid/types.rst`, "Recursive Types") that entails it: with no declared
supertypes the side condition on supertype indices --- the one the note there
says "ensures that a declared supertype is a previously defined type,
preventing cyclic subtype hierarchies" --- is vacuous, and `Comptype_ok/func`
reduces to validity of the parameter and result value types, which holds
because number types are "universally valid" (`valid/types.rst`, opening
paragraph).  Requiring it is what stops a module from carrying an ill-formed
type declaration --- a supertype index pointing past the end of the type
section, say --- through validation in an entry no function names. -/

extended with the function's locals and with its result type as the sole label;
`appendix/algorithm.rst` states the same fact operationally --- "every function
has an implicit outermost label that corresponds to an implicit block frame".
The label stack is therefore seeded with the function's result arity, so that a
`br 0` at the top of a body is a return, exactly as in Core. -/

`syntax/modules.rst` ("Exports"): "Each export is labeled by a unique name",
and, at "Imports", "unlike export names, import names are not necessarily
unique".  `appendix/embedding.rst` reads the same constraint back out of
