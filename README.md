# WASM-GEMM-GNAF

A Lean 4 mechanization targeting a kernel-checked global-optimality theorem for a
committed WebAssembly GEMM binary, under the pinned UOR-GNAF authority.

## Status

> Global optimality is the release theorem required by `SPEC.md`; it has not been
> established. No current test, benchmark, candidate search, or partial proof may
> be cited as that theorem.

That paragraph is mandated verbatim by `SPEC.md` §21 for the pre-closure state and
must not be edited while the state holds.

The repository's exact terminal answer for the requested claim is
`WorkloadIncomplete` — a branch of the UOR-GNAF §10.9 total answer carrier, and the
branch its §13.3 *requires* when the argmin proof is not closed. The full obligation
ledger, including the two framings that adversarial review **refuted**, is in
[CERTIFICATION.md](CERTIFICATION.md).

`just vv` fails at gate step 9. That is the correct behavior. A green gate in this
state would mean the gate had been weakened.

## What is proved

Kernel-checked in Lean 4.30.0, sorry-free; the live inventory is the first line of
[CONFORMANCE.md](CONFORMANCE.md). Axiom closure is `propext`, `Quot.sound`, and `Classical.choice` on
Prop-level results — all three Lean core axioms, named individually per `SPEC.md` §4.

| Declaration | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `Universal.exists_globalOptimal_of_nonempty` | **some byte sequence satisfies `GlobalOptimal` in full**, given nonemptiness |
| `Universal.systemEvaluation_subsingleton` | the evaluation type is a subsingleton — what makes `GlobalOptimal` satisfiable |
| `Cost.coordinate_le_score` | each of the 36 charged coordinates is ≤ the canonical score |
| `Cost.CanonicalObjective.monotone` | componentwise ≤ implies score ≤ |
| `Wasm.mem_successors_iff_step` | the successor enumerator *is* the `Step` relation |
| `Wasm.encode_decode_roundtrip` | binary round-trip for the modelled subset |
| `Wasm.costed_run_iff_plain_run` | cost instrumentation is transparent (§7.5) |
| `Atlas.semantic_closure_least` | least closure, and it equals the derivation closure |
| `Atlas.incremental_eq_full_rebuild` | incremental accumulation = full rebuild |
| `Atlas.universalCoverCompleteCheck_scope_blind` | the seal cannot stand in for coverage |

`coordinate_le_score` is load-bearing twice over: it makes every score sublevel
finite, and it bounds minimizers to a finite carrier so the argmin exists.

## What is not proved, and what that now means

The optimality *half* is discharged. `exists_globalOptimal_of_nonempty` proves that
a canonical-least minimizer exists and satisfies `GlobalOptimal` — the lower bound
falls out of the argmin rather than needing an analytic certificate, because the
artifact is defined as the selection.

What remains is **exhibition**, not bounding:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GO-006` | nonemptiness — one concrete module with proofs of the three extensional predicates (SPEC §13 Phase B) |
| `GO-007` | identification — the committed literal equals the selected bytes |
| `WS-001` | Core 3.0 semantics beyond the modelled `i32` subset |
| `BI-002` | the compiler covers all four arithmetic modes, not only modular-`u32` |

Nothing outstanding is stubbed, axiomatized, or assumed — per `SPEC.md` §19 those
declarations are simply **absent**, and the registry records them as `open`.
Omission is the conforming representation of an undischarged obligation.

## Scope of the word "optimal"

Every use of "globally optimal" in this repository refers to the exact abstract
UOR-Wasm cost objective defined in `SPEC.md` §9 — a weight-one sum over 36 charged
coordinates. **It is not a claim about physical latency on any engine or
processor.** Core WebAssembly specifies behavior, not host latency. No benchmark,
throughput measurement, or cross-engine run can discharge it.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `SPEC.md` | the normative implementation contract |
| `CERTIFICATION.md` | the terminal answer and obligation ledger |
| `authority/` | pinned immutable authorities and the frozen `WGG-GO-1` proposition |
| `WasmGemmGnaf/Cost/` | cost vectors and the canonical proper objective |

| `model/claims.json` | the claim registry; every claim carries its level |

## Claim discipline

Claim levels are load-bearing (`SPEC.md` §17.1). Only `formalProof` supports the
words "proved", "theorem", or "globally optimal". `authority`, `buildEvidence`,
`measurement`, and `open` do not, and no test or benchmark promotes a claim across
that line.
