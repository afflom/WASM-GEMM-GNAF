  Wasm/Config.lean --- frames, labels, stacks, instantiation and the harness
  control frame.

  Normative source: SPEC.md section 7.1 ("`Config` owns frames, labels, stacks,
  threads of control, instantiation, start invocation, and export calls") and
  section 7.2, which fixes the initial configuration protocol: "deterministic
  allocation, global/table/memory/data initialization, and construction of a
  harness control frame before executing a module start function; the costed
  harness then explores every permitted start-function branch, copies the raw
  invocation bytes only after a normal start return, and invokes `gemm`".

  The configuration is a single thread of control: a store, the harness
  descriptor, a frame of `i32` locals, an operand stack, the remaining
  instruction sequence, a control stack of labels, the harness phase, the
  snapshot taken at entry to `gemm`, and a terminal status.  Every value of the
  declared subset is an `i32`, so an operand stack is a list of words.

  Every declaration in this file is proved.  Nothing is assumed.

/-- The Core traps reachable in the declared subset. -/

/-! ## Control stack -/

/-- One entry of the control stack: a label.  `body` is the instruction
sequence re-entered by a branch to a `loop`; `cont` is the sequence resumed on
normal exit or on a branch to a `block`; `height` is the operand-stack height
at the moment the label was pushed, which is the height a branch restores. -/

  /-- The loop body, re-entered by a branch to a `loop` label. -/

  /-- The continuation resumed on exit or on a branch to a `block` label. -/
  cont : List Instr
  /-- The operand-stack height restored by a branch to this label. -/

/-- Restore an operand stack to a recorded height by discarding the values
pushed since the label was entered.  The stack is stored top first. -/

/-! ## The harness -/

/-- The harness control frame of SPEC section 7.2: the exported `gemm` body,
the raw invocation bytes to be installed, and the arguments passed to `gemm`. -/
structure Harness where
  /-- The body of the exported `gemm` function. -/
  gemmBody : List Instr
  /-- The number of declared locals of `gemm`, beyond its two parameters. -/

/-! ## Events

An event labels one reduction.  Every permitted nondeterministic choice is
recorded in the event, so two distinct successors of one configuration always
carry distinct labels. -/
