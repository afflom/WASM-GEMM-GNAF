# GNAF: what the compiler is proved to guarantee about execution (SPEC §11.4)

This file collects the refinement facts that the *current* state of the Wasm
layer actually supports, and states precisely which SPEC §11.4 obligations are
therefore **not** discharged anywhere in this repository.

## What is proved here

`Wasm/Config.lean` fixes initialization: `Wasm.initialConfig` validates the
module, allocates the store, locates the exported `gemm`, and builds the
harness control frame.  Because `GNAF.compile_validates` proves the emitted
module passes release validation, and because the emitted module's shape is
fixed, initialization of a compiled module can be computed exactly:

* `GNAF.compile_initialConfig` — the initial configuration of a compiled module
  is a specific configuration, given in closed form;
* `GNAF.compile_no_instantiation_fault` — no compiled module ever produces an
  instantiation fault;
* `GNAF.compile_gemmBody` — the harness runs exactly the compiled body;
* `GNAF.compile_runInvariant` — the initial configuration satisfies
  `Wasm.RunInvariant`, so `Wasm.returned_has_entry_store` applies to every run
  of a compiled module: a normally returning run of a compiled artifact has
  crossed the harness boundary and carries exactly one entry store.

The last section closes the anti-vacuity gap of SPEC §8.3: `GNAF.gemmWitness` is
a concrete `1×1×1` modular-`u32` GEMM plan proved to lie inside
`Plan.inReleasedSubset`, so `GNAF.code_no_unreachable` and the other in-subset
results have an exhibited inhabitant rather than an unwitnessed domain.  The
witness is not only in the subset: `GNAF.gemmWitness_writes_C` proves that
running it deposits the modular product into the declared `C` region, so the
inhabitant is a plan that genuinely computes a GEMM rather than a plan that
merely type checks.

The final section removes the witness's *fixed-extent* limitation.
`GNAF.gemmKernel` is an **input-dependent** GEMM plan: it loads the descriptor's
`m`, `n` and `k` out of the raw ABI header with `Plan.loadReg` and runs an
`i`/`j`/`k` nest of `Plan.loopReg` loops bounded by exactly those registers, so
no extent occurs anywhere in the plan text.  `GNAF.gemmKernel_writes_C` proves
that the declared `C` region then holds the modular-`u32` product for *arbitrary*
`m`, `n`, `k` (under hypotheses stated exactly there), and the same
`CheckedPlan` is exhibited computing correctly on three different shapes —
`1×1×1`, `2×2×2` and the rectangular `1×3×2`.

## What is deliberately omitted, and why

* **`compile_refines`** (SPEC §11.4).  Omitted.  It would relate
  `Wasm.FiniteExecution` of the compiled module to `GNAF.Accepts`.  The GNAF
  machine of `GNAF/Semantics.lean` computes over unbounded `Nat` cells while
  the Wasm machine computes over `i32`, so the statement is *false* as written
  without an explicit boundedness precondition and an explicit representation
  relation between a `GNAF.Machine` and a `Wasm.Config`; and proving even the
  bounded version needs a simulation argument for every plan constructor, which
  is not established here.  Weakening the statement — for instance quantifying
  only over runs that happen to exist, or replacing `Accepts` by an
  observational projection — would produce a theorem that looks like a
  refinement result and is not one, so nothing of the kind is stated.
* **`compile_cost_exact`** (SPEC §11.4).  Omitted.  `Wasm/Costed.lean` does
  supply a costed reduction relation (`Wasm.CostedReduces`), so the statement
  could now be *written*; but its content is that the measured cost of a costed
  run of the compiled module equals `GNAF.certifiedCost` of the plan, and that
  is strictly stronger than the refinement theorem above, which is not proved.
  Stating it with a hypothesis nobody can discharge, or proving a variant whose
  cost function is read off the compiler rather than from the plan, would both
  be worse than saying nothing: neither would be the SPEC obligation.
* **A step bound for the emitted module.**  `GNAF.compile_resources` in
  `GNAF/Compile.lean` bounds the emitted module's *code size* by the plan's
  declared static cost.  A bound on the number of Wasm reduction steps would be
  a consequence of the missing refinement theorem and is not claimed.

Every declaration in this file is proved.  Nothing is assumed.

/-! ## The anti-vacuity GEMM witness (SPEC §8.3)

`compile_validates` holds for every `CheckedPlan`, and `code_no_unreachable`
holds for every plan inside `Plan.inReleasedSubset`.  Both are universally
quantified, so on their own neither exhibits a single plan that is *both*
inside the subset and a GEMM.  This section supplies one.

`gemmWitness` is a complete released-profile plan: it classifies the raw ABI
header, dispatches on the declared layout class, runs the blocked traversal and
the `i`/`j` loop nest, accumulates the `k` reduction under the modular-`u32`
arithmetic contract of SPEC §8.2, sets the released status word, and constructs
the output from the declared `C` region.  It is checked at a *scalar* interface
(`Sig.lanes = 0`), so `hasType_no_vector` applies to it as well.

The GNAF machine of `GNAF/Semantics.lean` is cell addressed: `Machine.byteAt i`
is memory cell `i`, and `reduce` reads one whole element per cell.  The witness
header therefore lays SPEC §8.3's header table out cell-wise, and the three
matrix elements occupy the three cells after it.  No claim is made here that
this cell image equals the byte image produced by `Gemm/ABI.lean`'s
`encodeHeader`; that is a byte-level representation statement about a different
machine model and it is not proved anywhere, so it is not asserted.

### Where the result goes

The kernel deposits its accumulator into the declared `C` region with
`Plan.storeReg`, the constructor that moves a register into memory; its
load-after-store law is `GNAF.storeReg_reads_back` and its frame law is
`GNAF.storeReg_outside`.  `gemmWitness_eval_acc` proves the product is computed
exactly, `gemmWitness_eval_mem` gives the memory the store leaves — the
four-cell little-endian image of that product at `C` — and
`gemmWitness_writes_C` reads that image back: **after evaluation the `C` region
holds `alpha · A · B + beta · C` modulo `2 ^ 32`**, which is what makes this
plan a GEMM and not merely a well-typed plan.  `gemmWitness_eval_mem_outside`
is the matching frame statement: every cell outside `C`'s four keeps its entry
value.  The store is a *cell-wise little-endian* image, exactly as
`Machine.u16At` reads cells; no claim is made here that it coincides with the
byte image of `Gemm/ABI.lean`, for the same reason the header image is not
claimed to.

Three things `gemmWitness_writes_C` does **not** say, stated precisely because
the theorem is the first link of SPEC §13 Phase B and its strength matters:

* **It is the `alpha = 1`, `beta = 0` instance.**  `gemmWitnessAlpha` and
  `gemmWitnessBeta` are the scalars read out of the witness header's own
  `alpha` and `beta` fields, and that header declares `alpha = 1` and
  `beta = 0` (`gemmWitnessAlpha_eq`, `gemmWitnessBeta_eq`).  The plan contains
  no scaling node at all, so the theorem holds *because* those two literals are
  `1` and `0`; it does not generalize to a descriptor declaring other scalars,
  and no such generalization is claimed anywhere.
* **It is a statement about `Plan.eval`, not about the emitted Wasm.**
  Relating the two is `compile_refines`, which is omitted above for the reasons
  given there.
* **The witness descriptor's cell image still has overlapping regions.**  The
  header declares `A`, `B` and `C` element lengths of four bytes each while the
  cell model gives `A` and `B` one cell apiece, and it declares the
  status-detail record at cell `259`, which `C`'s four cells run into.
  `Machine.classify` checks the header literals, the declared kind/mode triple
  and the invocation extent — it does not check region disjointness — so
  `gemmWitnessMachine_classify` is not evidence that these regions are
  disjoint, and no disjointness is claimed.  The cells `C` overlaps are written
  by no other node of this plan and read by none, so the theorems above are
  unaffected; a descriptor-level `disjoint` obligation would have to be
  discharged against `Gemm/Descriptor.lean`, and it is not discharged here.

What the witness *does* now publish is the whole result: `C` is declared as its
four stored cells, so `buildOutput` emits the complete little-endian image of
the product (`gemmWitness_eval_out`) rather than one byte of it. -/

/-! ## The input-dependent GEMM kernel (SPEC §11.1; SPEC §3 input totality)

`gemmWitness` above is a *fixed-extent* plan: its loop bounds and its reduction
length are literals of the plan text, so it computes one shape and one shape
only.  `gemmKernel` is the plan that removes that limitation, using the two
constructors `GNAF/Plan.lean` added for it.  It

1. classifies the raw ABI header (`Plan.classifyRaw`) and dispatches on the
   declared layout class (`Plan.dispatchLayout`);
2. **loads** the declared extents `m`, `n`, `k` out of the header — SPEC §8.3
   puts them at cells `16..23`, `24..31`, `32..39`, little-endian — into scalar
   registers `3`, `4`, `5` with `Plan.loadReg` (`gemmKernel_loads_extents`);
3. runs an `i`/`j`/`k` nest of three `Plan.loopReg` loops **bounded by exactly
   those registers**, so every trip count is a function of the input and of
   nothing in the plan text (`gemmKernelNest_trips`);
4. accumulates the reduction, one multiply-accumulate per `k` iteration;
5. deposits each result into the declared `C` region with `Plan.storeReg`, as
   the four-cell little-endian `u32` image the released contract fixes;
6. sets the released status word and constructs the output from `C`.

### Why the addressing is computed rather than declared

A GNAF `IndexMap` is affine with coefficients *fixed by the plan text*, so no
index map can express the address of `A[i,t]`: that address is
`256 + 4 · (i · k + t)` and `k` is the loaded extent, not a literal.  The kernel
therefore computes each element address into scalar register `0` with
`Plan.scalarOp` and reads it through `IndexMap.idB`, whose `storeAddr` is
`base + reg 0` — the same addressing `storeReg` and `loadReg` share.  Address
arithmetic is consequently *data* in this plan, exactly as the extents are.
This is what makes the kernel shape-generic; it is also why the theorems below
never mention a literal extent.

### The register and memory map

| register | contents |
|---|---|
| `0` | computed element address (the `b` slot `storeAddr` reads) |
| `3`, `4`, `5` | the loaded extents `m`, `n`, `k` |
| `6`, `7`, `8` | the `i`, `j`, `k` loop counters (`loopReg` index registers) |
| `9` | the accumulator |
| `10`, `11`, `12` | the loaded `A` element, `B` element and their product |
| `13` | the stored element width, `4` cells |

The observable memory is 1024 cells: the 256-cell SPEC §8.3 header, then 256
cells of `A` at `256`, 256 cells of `B` at `512`, and 256 cells of `C` at `768`.
Every element is a four-cell little-endian `u32`, so each region holds up to 64
elements — the source of the `m·k ≤ 64`, `k·n ≤ 64`, `m·n ≤ 64` hypotheses
below.  As with `gemmWitness`, no claim is made that this cell image coincides
with the byte image of `Gemm/ABI.lean`; that is a different machine model and it
is not proved anywhere.

### The modular-`u32` contract

`ScalarOp` has no truncating operation, so the `k` accumulation runs over
unbounded `Nat` and truncation happens where the released ABI puts it: the
four-cell `Plan.storeReg` into `C` keeps the result modulo `2 ^ 32`.
`gemmKernel_C_is_contract_fold` proves that what lands in `C` is exactly the
fold of `ArithmeticContract.step` for the modular-`u32` contract
`gemmKernelContract` — the same contract `gemmWitness` declares — so the
reduction is performed under the declared contract of SPEC §8.2 and not merely
under a formula that happens to agree with it.

### The reach of `gemmKernel_writes_C`, stated exactly

`gemmKernel_writes_C` is proved for **arbitrary `m`, `n`, `k` and an arbitrary
entry memory**, under exactly these hypotheses, all of them discharged by `rfl`
or `decide` on the concrete descriptors further down:

* the configuration conforms to the kernel's interface (`regs` file of 14 cells,
  1024 memory cells);
* the descriptor classifies `valid` and its layout class is `rowMajor` — those
  are the two continuations the kernel body sits in;
* the header words at `16`, `24`, `32` are `m`, `n`, `k`;
* `m, n, k ≤ loopRegMaxTrips`, so the `loopReg` clamp is inert (it is the
  released `i32` ceiling, so this excludes nothing the ABI can present);
* `m·k ≤ 64`, `k·n ≤ 64`, `m·n ≤ 64`, so `A`, `B` and `C` fit their declared
  256-cell regions and are therefore disjoint;
* `i < m` and `j < n`.

Three descriptors of three *different* shapes are then exhibited, and the same
plan is proved to compute the right product on each:
`gemmKernel_writes_C_1x1x1` (`1×1×1`), `gemmKernel_writes_C_2x2x2` (`2×2×2`, all
four entries) and `gemmKernel_writes_C_1x3x2` (`1×3×2`, a rectangular shape with
`k ≠ n`, all three entries).  That is the evidence that the fixed-extent
limitation is gone: one `CheckedPlan`, three shapes, no plan-text extent.

### What is still *not* proved here

* **Nothing relates this plan to the emitted Wasm.**  `compile_refines` remains
  omitted for the reasons given at the top of this file; `gemmKernel_compiles`
  says the compiled module validates, nothing more.
* **`alpha` and `beta` are not applied.**  The kernel computes `A · B`, the
  `alpha = 1`, `beta = 0` instance of SPEC §8, exactly as `gemmWitness` does.
  The kernel contains no scaling node.
* **The declared strides are not consulted.**  The kernel assumes the packed
  row-major layout that `Machine.layoutClass` selects; the hypothesis
  `m.layoutClass = .rowMajor` is what licenses that, and a descriptor declaring
  a non-packed row-major view would still enter the kernel.  Nothing here proves
  anything about such a descriptor.
* **The batch axis is not traversed.**  This is the `batch = 1` instance.
* **The region bound is a *hypothesis*, not a check.**  A descriptor declaring
  `m·n > 64` is not refused by this plan; it is simply outside the theorem.  The
  released classifier does not check it either (`Machine.classify` checks the
  header literals, the kind/mode triple and the invocation extent), so no
  disjointness or capacity claim is made beyond the stated hypotheses.

/-! ### Concrete descriptors of three different shapes

`gemmKernelHeader` is a SPEC §8.3 header for a row-major, modular-`u32`,
`batch = 1` GEMM of the given shape.  Its field assignment is the one
`Machine.classify` and `Machine.layoutClass` read: cells `0..15` carry the magic,
version, header size, the four kind tags and the mode tag; `16..47` the extents
and the batch; each of the three 40-cell view records carries offset, row
stride, **column stride**, batch stride and byte length, so that the cell pair
`64..65` that `Machine.layoutClass` compares against the stored width is the
column stride — which is the element width exactly when the view is packed
row-major.  As with `gemmWitness`, this is a *cell* image; no claim is made that
it equals `Gemm/ABI.lean`'s byte image. -/

/-! ### The kernel's static step bound (BI-006, step 1)

`Plan.loopReg` reads its trip count out of a register, so its *executed* step
count is a function of the input; `GNAF/Plan.lean` clamps the executed trip
count at `loopRegMaxTrips = 2 ^ 32 - 1` and charges `loopRegMaxTrips`
iterations of the body to the loop, and `Plan.steps_le_stepBound` proves that
the executed count of *any* plan on *any* configuration is under the resulting
static number.  For `gemmKernel` — three nested `loopReg` loops — that number is
therefore finite even though nothing in the plan text names an extent, and this
section computes it and compares it against the released step budget of SPEC
§8.3, `2 ^ 320`.

**The exact reach of what follows.**  `Plan.steps` counts steps of the *GNAF*
machine of `GNAF/Semantics.lean` — the interpreter `Plan.eval` — and of nothing
else.  These theorems say nothing whatever about the number of *Wasm* reduction
steps the compiled module `compile gemmKernelChecked` takes: relating the two is
the refinement obligation this file's header lists as omitted, and it is still
omitted.  `compile_resources` does not supply it either; it bounds the emitted
module's static instruction *count*, and explicitly not its execution.  See
`Release.GemmKernelReducesBounded` in `Artifact/Release.lean` for the exact
statement that is missing. -/

/-- The kernel's static step bound, as a literal.  Three nested `loopReg` loops

theorem gemmKernel_stepBound_eq :
    gemmKernelChecked.plan.stepBound = 792281624699921518248014643209 := rfl

/-- **BI-006, step 1.**  The kernel's static step bound is inside the released
costed step budget of SPEC §8.3, with about `2 ^ 220` to spare.  This is a
statement about `Plan.stepBound`, a number computed from the plan text; see the
section header for what it does *not* say. -/

theorem gemmKernel_stepBound_lt_maxSteps :
    gemmKernelChecked.plan.stepBound < 2 ^ 320 := by decide

/-- **Every GNAF evaluation of the kernel is inside the released step budget.**
On *every* configuration — every descriptor, every extent the header can
declare — the kernel's executed `Plan.steps` count is at most `2 ^ 320`.  This
is `Plan.steps_le_stepBound` instantiated at the kernel; it is about
`Plan.eval`, not about the emitted Wasm. -/
theorem gemmKernel_steps_le_maxSteps (m : Machine) :
    gemmKernel.steps m ≤ 2 ^ 320 :=
  Nat.le_trans (Plan.steps_le_stepBound gemmKernel m) gemmKernel_stepBound_le_maxSteps

the released step budget as well. -/
