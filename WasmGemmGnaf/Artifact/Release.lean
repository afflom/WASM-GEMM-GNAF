/-
  Artifact/Release.lean --- the concrete release instantiation, and UV-003.

  Normative sources: SPEC.md sections 1 (`GlobalOptimal`), 7.2 (the release
  profile), 8.3 (the release problem), 9.3 (the release objective), 10.1 (the
  competitor universe and `Universal.evaluate`) and 13 (Phase D).

  ## WHAT THIS FILE PROVES

  It fixes the release scope — profile, problem, setting, objective — and it
  *constructs* a `Release.Seam` (§5) whose cost model, validation cost, resource
  budget and costed machine are all closed terms, with a `Universal.SystemEvaluation`
  inhabitant on a closed byte literal.

  ## WHAT THIS FILE NO LONGER PROVES: UV-003 IS OPEN

  This file used to discharge obligation **UV-003** — the decider hypothesis
  `Universal.DeciderAnswersAdmissible` that `Universal/Argmin.lean` isolates and
  cannot derive — with `Release.decider`, a `noncomputable` one-field wrapper
  around `Release.evaluateClassically`.  That evaluator assumed `Nonempty
  (Universal.SystemEvaluation …)` and extracted an inhabitant by
  `Classical.choice`: it decoded nothing, validated nothing, enumerated no input
  and explored no branch.

  An external audit ruled that a non-conforming discharge, and it is right.
  SPEC §10.1 asks for an *implemented* finite decoder, validator, input
  enumerator and all-branch explorer.  A classically chosen inhabitant of the
  answer type is not an implementation of anything; it is the conclusion
  assumed under a different name.  SPEC §19 and §6.3 exclude noncomputable
  definitions from the release path, and `just releasepath` enforces it.

  **`Release.decider` and `Release.evaluateClassically` are therefore deleted,
  together with every declaration stated against them** — the relational
  soundness / functionality / completeness results, `deciderAnswersAdmissible`,
  both `exists_globalOptimal_*` reductions, `nonemptiness_iff_admissible_evaluation`,
  `seam_decider_complete_on_witness`, `globalOptimal_of_witness_semantics`, and
  their `Theorems.Release.*` re-indexings.  They are absent, not relabelled and
  not hidden behind a checker.  No replacement evaluator over the witness
  semantics is offered either: that was explicitly forbidden, and it would be
  the same substitution wearing a computable-looking hat.

  Consequences, stated plainly:

  * UV-003 is **open**.  `Universal.exists_globalOptimal_of_nonempty` still has
    two hypotheses and this repository discharges neither at the release scope.
  * This repository states **no** `Universal.GlobalOptimal` result at the
    release scope, conditional or otherwise.  There is no decider to state one
    against.
  * Closing UV-003 means *implementing* SPEC §10.1's explorer as a
    `Universal.Decider (setting seam)` on the real decoder, validator, the
    `Universal.enumerateInputs` enumerator and `Wasm.exploreAllCosted`, and
    proving `Universal.DeciderAnswersAdmissible` of that.

  Every declaration in this file is a definition or a proved theorem; there is
  no `sorry`, no `admit`, no project axiom, no `native_decide`, no `unsafe`, no
  `partial` and, now, no `noncomputable`.

  ## THE SEAM IS CONSTRUCTED (GO-008)

  §5 below builds a `Release.Seam` and proves it is not degenerate.  Items 2, 3
  and 4 of what used to be this file's hypothesis list are now definitions:

  * `Release.semantics` — `Release.costEvent` together with
    `Wasm.validationCost` and `Wasm.instantiatedStaticBytes`, assembled by
    `Release.semanticsFor`.
  * `Release.machine` — `Wasm.releaseCostedMachine` of `Wasm/CostedExplore.lean`:
    `Wasm.initialGemmInvocationCosted` and the bounded all-branch costed
    explorer `Wasm.exploreAllCosted`.
  * `Release.limit` — five coordinates pinned verbatim from
    `Gemm.releaseResourceContract`, eleven supplied at the profile maximum the
    pinned costed-step budget implies.  `Release.limit_pinned` and
    `Release.limit_unpinned` say which are which.
  * `Release.seam` — the three of them, as a closed term.

  Non-degeneracy is proved, not asserted:

  * `Release.seam_costEvent_not_zero` and `Release.seam_costEvent_charge_pos` —
    the cost model is not free.
  * `Release.seam_validationSteps_pos` — validation is not free.
  * `Release.seam_machine_completes` — on `Release.witnessModule` the machine
    initializes and returns a **completed, nonempty, canonically ordered**
    costed frontier at every raw invocation.
  * `Release.systemEvaluation_inhabited` — `Universal.SystemEvaluation` at
    `Release.setting Release.seam` is inhabited, on the closed literal
    `Release.witnessBytes`, which is also `Universal.ProfileValid`.

  ## THREE DISCLOSURES THAT TRAVEL WITH THE CONSTRUCTION

  1. **`Release.costEvent` is a lower bound, not SPEC §7.5's contribution law.**
     `Universal.Semantics.costEvent` maps a *plain* `Wasm.Event`, and a plain
     event does not carry the transferred byte count, the `memory.grow` delta or
     the installed byte count — `Wasm.Event.step` alone is the erasure of
     fourteen distinct rules.  `Release.costEvent` charges the pinned rule-step
     row for every event and the pinned dispatch row for the events whose
     dispatch is visible.  `Release.costEvent_le_eventContribution` proves the
     charge is componentwise **≤** `Wasm.eventContribution`, and
     `Release.costEvent_charge_wasmRuleSteps` proves it is never zero;
     `Release.costEvent_branch_charge` and `Release.costEvent_trap_charge` prove
     it is *exact* on the branch and trap rules.  It is not exact on arithmetic,
     memory access, `memory.grow`, `enterGemm`, `throw` or `return`.

  2. **`Release.witnessModule` is not a GEMM implementation, and is not
     `Artifact.baselineModule`.**  It is the smallest module `GNAF.moduleOf`
     emits — same shape, same pinned ABI type, same two exports, same
     single-page memory — whose body is `i32.const 0`.  Every branch of it
     terminates in at most three reduction steps, which is what makes the
     explorer dischargeable.  Discharging the machine on the compiled GEMM
     witness would require a termination proof for `GNAF.bodyCode`'s loops
     inside a `2 ^ 320` step budget, which this repository does not have and
     which no `decide` can supply at that fuel.  Everything proved about
     `Release.witnessModule` is about `Release.witnessModule`.

  3. **`Universal.Admissible` is still open.**  `Release.witness_profileValid`
     proves conjunct (a) and `Release.systemEvaluation_inhabited` proves
     conjunct (d), both on a closed literal.  `Universal.SemanticCorrect` —
     conjunct (b) — demands `Gemm.Reference.Accepts` at *every* raw invocation
     and is **false** for a module whose `gemm` returns the constant `0`; it is
     not claimed here, and nothing in this file concludes anything from it.
     `GO-006` is open.

  ## WHAT REMAINS A HYPOTHESIS, AND WHY

  One thing, and it is not faked.

  `[Foundation.Fintype (Gemm.RawInvocation Release.wasmProfile)]` — SPEC §8.4's
  `problem_input_fintype`.  `Universal/Competitor.lean` already takes it as a
  hypothesis; `Theorems/GemmTotal.lean` records it as **omitted** under `O-3`
  (the carrier is mathematically finite, but no duplicate-free covering `List`
  with its `Nodup` and coverage proofs exists here).  It is carried here as an
  instance-implicit argument, exactly as upstream, and §5.12 — including
  `Release.systemEvaluation_inhabited` — carries it.

  ## A DISCLOSED DEVIATION IN THE PROFILE

  SPEC §7.2 fixes `Release.wasmProfile` as
  `Wasm.Profile.checked (Wasm.canonicalCore3Wasm32ProfileBody … Release.wasmCostTableBody)`,
  and SPEC §7.5 builds `Release.wasmCostTableBody` with
  `Wasm.buildCanonicalCostTable` from the vendored Core 3.0 conformance map.
  `Wasm.buildCanonicalCostTable`, `Release.core3RuleConformanceMap`,
  `Release.canonicalRuleContribution` and
  `Release.canonicalInitializationContribution` **do not exist** in this
  repository, and `vendor/wasm-spec` contains no conformance data.

  `Release.wasmProfile` below is therefore `Wasm.unitWitnessProfile`: the same
  `Wasm.canonicalCore3Wasm32ProfileBody` at the same pinned
  `Wasm.core3RevisionCommit`, with `Wasm.canonicalCostTableUnits` in place of
  the release cost table.  Every projection SPEC §7.2 names — address bits,
  page limit, invocation-byte ceiling, feature table, closed import policy,
  required exports, resource limits, nondeterminism policy, the three semantics
  identities, and the eight cost *units* — is the canonical release value.

  `ruleRows` and `initializationRows` are **no longer empty** (that was CO-006):
  `Wasm.canonicalCostTableUnits` now carries one row per `Wasm.RuleId` and one
  per `Wasm.InitEventId`, proved to be a duplicate-free exact cover
  (`Wasm.canonicalCostTable_exact_cover`,
  `Wasm.canonicalCostTable_ruleRows_nodup`,
  `Wasm.canonicalCostTable_covers_every_rule`) and proved to charge exactly what
  the contribution law charges (`Wasm.canonicalCostTable_charges_exactly`).

  What still differs from SPEC §7.2 is the *provenance* of those rows: they are
  written here and checked against this repository's own `eventContribution`,
  not derived by `Wasm.buildCanonicalCostTable` from a vendored Core 3.0
  conformance map, which does not exist here.  This is disclosed, not hidden:
  the profile below is **not** SPEC §7.2's release literal, and no theorem in
  this file should be cited as if it were.  When the conformance-map layer
  lands, exactly one definition — `Release.wasmProfile` — changes, and nothing
  else in this file does.

/-- **SPEC §7.5, the audit rows.**  The profile's cost table carries an exact,
duplicate-free cover of every pinned Core rule identifier and of every harness
initialization event identifier.  This was CO-006: the rows used to be empty,
so `rowFor?` returned `none` for every rule and every per-rule charge collapsed
to the uniform `ruleStepUnit`. -/

The objective is `Cost.canonicalObjective`, whose body assigns weight one to
every constructor of `Cost.ArtifactCoordinate` and whose tie order is
`.unsignedByteLexicographic`.  It is indexed by the *universal* problem of the
setting, so it is defined after §2 below. -/

/-! ## 2. The release setting (SPEC §10.1)

`Universal.Setting` has three fields.  One of them — the problem — is fully
determined by §1 and `Gemm.Reference.Accepts`.  The other two are the seams
`Universal/Competitor.lean` documents at its head.  They are carried as
*parameters* through §2–§4, together with the per-invocation resource limit
vector, so that every result below holds for **every** costed semantics, costed
machine and limit; §5 then supplies one of each and proves the supplied triple
non-degenerate, so the parametrised results are not vacuous. -/

/-- **SPEC §7.5's two static cost counters, supplied.**  Given an event charge,
this assembles the whole `Universal.Semantics` at the release profile from
`Wasm.validationCost` and `Wasm.instantiatedStaticBytes`.  §5.1 supplies the
event charge (`Release.costEvent`) and §5.2 instantiates this at it. -/

/--
  The three pieces of the release setting that `Universal/Competitor.lean`
  leaves as seams.

  This is data only; it carries no proposition, and in particular no
  correctness, coverage, feasibility or optimality claim.  §2–§4 quantify over
  it so that the release results hold for every inhabitant; §5 constructs
  `Release.seam` and proves it non-degenerate, which is what stops those results
  from being implications with an unsatisfiable antecedent.

/-! ## 3. The release decider — REMOVED

There is no `Release.decider` and no `Release.evaluateClassically`.

What used to stand here was a `noncomputable` evaluator that assumed `Nonempty
(Universal.SystemEvaluation …)` and extracted an inhabitant with
`Classical.choice`, wrapped in a one-field `Universal.Decider`.  It decoded
nothing, validated nothing, enumerated no input and explored no branch, and an
external audit ruled it a non-conforming discharge of **UV-003**: SPEC §10.1
asks for an *implemented* finite decoder, validator, input enumerator and
all-branch explorer, and a classically chosen inhabitant is none of those.
`just releasepath` now rejects exactly that shape (SPEC §19 / §6.3).

Every result that was stated against it — `decider_evaluate`,
`evaluateClassically_eq_complete`, `systemEvaluationRel_of_evaluation`,
`systemEvaluationRel_sound`, `systemEvaluationRel_functional`,
`systemEvaluationRel_complete`, `deciderAnswersAdmissible`,
`deciderAnswersAdmissible_rel`, `exists_globalOptimal_of_nonempty`,
`exists_globalOptimal_of_admissible_evaluation`,
`nonemptiness_iff_admissible_evaluation`, and their `Theorems.Release.*`
re-indexings — has been **deleted**, not relabelled and not hidden behind a
checker.  UV-003 is therefore open again, and the repository states no
`Universal.GlobalOptimal` result at the release scope at all.

No replacement evaluator over the witness semantics is offered: the audit
forbade that too.  The obligation is to *implement* SPEC §10.1's explorer as a
`Universal.Decider` and prove `Universal.DeciderAnswersAdmissible` of it.  Until
that exists, the honest state of this file is the absence below.

What survives is everything that never needed a decider: the scope objects of
§1 and §2, the constructed seam of §5, and the `Universal.SystemEvaluation`
inhabitant of §5.14 — which is decider-independent data. -/

end Parametric

/-! ## 5. The seam, constructed (GO-008)

Everything above is universally quantified over `(seam : Seam)`, so every
release theorem is an implication whose antecedent may be unsatisfiable.  This
section removes that possibility by *building* a `Seam` and proving it is not
degenerate.

### 5.1 The event charge (SPEC §7.5)

`Universal.Semantics.costEvent` maps a **plain** `Wasm.Event` to a `Cost.Event`.
`Wasm/Costed.lean`'s contribution law is stated on `Wasm.CostedEvent`, which
carries data the plain event does not: `Wasm.Event.step` is the erasure of
fourteen different rules, `Event.growAttempt (.grown p)` records the pages held
*before* the grow and not the delta, and `Event.enterGemm` does not record how
many raw bytes were installed.  A configuration-free charge therefore cannot be
the contribution law, and pretending otherwise would invent numbers.

`Release.costEvent` charges, for each plain event, the largest charge that the
event alone determines: the pinned rule-step row for every event, plus the
pinned dispatch row for the six dispatching rules whose erasure is
distinguishable (`branch`, `enterGemm`, `throwEvent`, `returnEvent`).  Two
theorems below say exactly what that buys and exactly what it costs:

* `costEvent_charge_wasmRuleSteps` — **no event is free**: every plain event is
  charged one `wasmRuleSteps` unit, which is the pinned `ruleStepUnit` of the
  release cost table.
* `costEvent_le_eventContribution` — **nothing is over-charged**: for every
  costed event, the charge of its erasure is componentwise `≤` the contribution
  law's charge for it.  The inequality is strict exactly on the coordinates the
  plain event cannot determine (`scalarOps` on arithmetic, `bytesRead` and
  `bytesWritten` on memory access and raw installation, `memoryGrowPages` on a
  successful grow, the GC coordinates on a throw, `outputBytes` on a return).

So this is an honest *lower* bound on the cost model, not the cost model.  It is
disclosed here and again in `Theorems/Status.lean`. -/

/-- **SPEC §7.5**, the release event charge: the pinned per-rule row that the
plain event determines on its own.  See the section header for what it under-

`Gemm.releaseResourceContract` names six numbers; `Cost.DynamicVector` has
sixteen coordinates.  Five coordinates are *pinned*: they are a contract field
verbatim.  The remaining eleven are *supplied at the profile maximum* implied by
the pinned costed-step budget, under one uniform rule — a coordinate charged at
most `k` per costed reduction step is bounded by `maxCostedSteps * k`, and `k`
is read off the pinned per-rule rows of `Wasm.eventContribution`:

| coordinate | value | why |
|---|---|---|
| `wasmRuleSteps` | `maxCostedSteps` | **pinned** (§8.2, costed steps) |
| `peakPages` | `maxPages` | **pinned** (§8.2, ordinary memory) |
| `tableElementsAllocated` | `maxTableElements` | **pinned** (§8.2, tables) |
| `peakGcLiveBytes` | `maxHeapBytes` | **pinned** (§8.2, GC/exception heap) |
| `peakStackValues` | `maxValueSlots` | **pinned** (§8.2, live value slots) |
| `instantiationSteps` | `maxCostedSteps` | ≤ 1 per rule step |
| `dispatchSteps` | `maxCostedSteps` | ≤ 1 per rule step |
| `preparationSteps` | `maxCostedSteps` | ≤ 1 per rule step |
| `scalarOps` | `maxCostedSteps` | ≤ 1 per rule step |
| `vectorLaneOps` | `maxCostedSteps` | the released profile charges none; not narrowed to `0` |
| `gcObjectsAllocated` | `maxCostedSteps` | ≤ 1 per rule step |
| `bytesRead` | `4 * maxCostedSteps` | ≤ `Wasm.i32TransferBytes` per rule step |
| `bytesWritten` | `4 * maxCostedSteps` | ≤ `Wasm.i32TransferBytes` per rule step |
| `outputBytes` | `4 * maxCostedSteps` | ≤ `Wasm.i32TransferBytes` per rule step |
| `gcBytesInitialized` | `24 * maxCostedSteps` | ≤ one canonical exception object per rule step |
| `memoryGrowPages` | `maxPages * maxCostedSteps` | ≤ `maxPages` per successful grow |

The eleven derived values are *upper* bounds, so the admissible competitor set
is not narrowed by them; it is widened as far as the pinned budget permits,
which makes `GlobalOptimal`'s universal clause harder, not easier.  Nothing here
is claimed to be SPEC §8.2's own sixteen-coordinate vector, which SPEC §8.2 does

/-! ### 5.9 The module the explorer is discharged on

`Artifact.baselineModule` — the compiled GEMM witness plan — is **not** the
module used here, and the reason is stated rather than hidden: discharging
`Wasm.exploreAllCosted` on it means proving that every branch of the compiled
blocked traversal terminates inside `2 ^ 320` steps, which needs a termination
argument for `GNAF.bodyCode`'s loops that this repository does not have, and
which no amount of `decide` can supply at that fuel.

Since BI-006, part of that is no longer vague.  §5.13 below carries the *real*
GEMM kernel — `GNAF.gemmKernel`, whose loop bounds are the header's declared
extents — as far as the Wasm layer allows: its compiled module is profile valid
on a closed literal, its plan-level static step bound is proved to be about
`2 ^ 99` and therefore strictly inside the `2 ^ 320` budget
(`GNAF.gemmKernel_stepBound_le_maxSteps`), and the whole machine and evaluation
chain is proved from two explicitly named propositions,
`Release.GemmKernelReducesBounded` and `Release.GemmKernelReachesTerminal`.
Those two are Wasm-execution facts, not plan facts, and neither is proved here;
the second one is `Wasm.validation_progress`, OUTSTANDING under `O-6`.

What is used instead is the smallest module `GNAF.moduleOf` emits: the same
module *shape* — one recursive type group, one function at the pinned `gemm` ABI
type, one exported single-page memory, no imports, no start function, exactly
the two required exports — with the shortest body the ABI admits, `i32.const 0`.
Every branch of it terminates in at most three reduction steps: install the raw
bytes and cross the harness boundary (or trap out of bounds), push the status
word, return it.

So the machine below is discharged on a real, profile-valid, decoding module,
and **not** on a GEMM implementation.  `Release.witnessModule` computes no
product; it is a witness that the costed machine completes, and it is cited as
nothing else. -/

/-! ### 5.13 The compiled GEMM kernel: what closes, and the two things that do not

`GNAF.gemmKernel` is the input-dependent GEMM plan of `GNAF/CompileCorrect.lean`
— it loads `m`, `n`, `k` out of the ABI header and runs an `i`/`j`/`k` nest of
`Plan.loopReg` loops bounded by exactly those registers — and
`GNAF.gemmKernel_writes_C` proves that evaluating it deposits the modular-`u32`
product into the declared `C` region.  This section carries that plan as far
toward the costed machine as the Wasm layer of this repository permits, and
states the remainder as two named propositions rather than assuming them.

**What is discharged here, unconditionally.**

* `Release.gemmKernelModule` — the module `GNAF.compile` emits from
  `GNAF.gemmKernelChecked` — validates, stays inside the profile limit table,
  imports nothing and carries exactly the two required exports, so
  `Release.gemmKernel_profileValid` holds on the closed byte literal
  `Release.gemmKernelBytes`.
* `GNAF.gemmKernel_stepBound_le_maxSteps` (proved in `GNAF/CompileCorrect.lean`)
  puts the plan's static step bound — `792281624699921518248014643209`, about
  `2 ^ 99`, the three clamped `loopReg` loops — strictly inside the released
  costed step budget `2 ^ 320`.  `Release.gemmKernel_stepBound_lt_maxSteps`
  restates it against `(setting seam).problem.maxSteps` itself.
* Given the two propositions below, the *whole* machine chain closes:
  `Release.gemmKernel_machine_completes_of`, and the evaluation
  `Release.gemmKernelSystemEvaluationOf` in §5.14.

**What does not close, stated exactly.**  `Plan.stepBound` bounds the step count
of the *GNAF* interpreter `Plan.eval`.  Nothing in this repository relates it to
the length of a *Wasm* reduction of the compiled module.  `GNAF.compile_resources`
does not: it bounds the emitted module's static instruction count and says so.
The two missing facts are exactly:

* `Release.GemmKernelReducesBounded` — every reduction of the compiled kernel
  from its initial configuration stays inside the released step budget.  This is
  the termination half of the omitted `compile_refines`: it needs a simulation
  between `Wasm.Step` on `GNAF.bodyCode` and `Plan.eval`, or at least a direct
  Wasm-level trip-count argument for every `countLoopVar` the compiler emits,
  and neither exists here.  `Release.gemmKernelReducesBounded_of_stepBound_multiple`
  shows that any bound of at most `2 ^ 220` Wasm steps per charged plan step
  suffices, so the gap is the existence of a bound and not its size.
* `Release.GemmKernelReachesTerminal` — some branch reaches a *terminal*
  configuration (`Wasm.observationOfConfig` is `none` on a running one, and a
  stuck-but-running configuration is exactly what a progress theorem excludes).
  This is `Wasm.validation_progress`, listed as OUTSTANDING under `O-6` in
  `Theorems/Status.lean`; no progress theorem exists for the modelled subset.

Neither is assumed anywhere: they appear only as explicit hypotheses of the
theorems that need them.  `Release.seam_machine_completes` and
`Release.systemEvaluation_inhabited` continue to be discharged on
`Release.witnessModule` alone. -/

theorem gemmKernel_stepBound_lt_maxSteps :
    GNAF.gemmKernelChecked.plan.stepBound < (setting seam).problem.maxSteps :=
  GNAF.gemmKernel_stepBound_lt_maxSteps

/-- **The first missing fact.**  Every reduction of the compiled kernel out of
its initial configuration stays inside the released costed step budget.

This is the termination half of SPEC §11.4's `compile_refines`, and it is
**not proved anywhere in this repository**: `Plan.steps_le_stepBound` bounds the
GNAF interpreter `Plan.eval`, `GNAF.compile_resources` bounds the emitted
module's static instruction count, and no theorem relates either to the length
of a `Wasm.Reduces` sequence.  Proving it needs a simulation between `Wasm.Step`
on `GNAF.bodyCode` and `Plan.eval`, or at least a direct Wasm-level trip-count
argument for every `countLoopVar` the compiler emits — the counter local is
incremented by one per iteration and compared unsigned against an extent local
that the loop body never writes, so the argument exists in outline and is simply
not mechanized here.

The bound is stated against the budget rather than against
`Plan.stepBound` on purpose: one plan node compiles to several Wasm
instructions, so a Wasm trace is *not* bounded by the plan's step count, and a
hypothesis that said so could be false and would make everything below vacuous.
`Release.gemmKernelReducesBounded_of_stepBound_multiple` records exactly how
much slack there is.  It appears below only as an explicit hypothesis. -/

  ∀ (raw : Gemm.RawInvocation wasmProfile) {tr : List Wasm.Event} {f : Wasm.Config},
    Wasm.Reduces (gemmKernelInitial raw) tr f →
      tr.length ≤ (setting seam).problem.maxSteps

/-- **The second missing fact.**  Some branch of the compiled kernel reaches a
*terminal* configuration inside the same budget.

`Wasm.observationOfConfig` is `none` on a running configuration, so a
stuck-but-running configuration produces no observation at all and the costed
frontier would be empty.  Excluding that is `Wasm.validation_progress`, listed
OUTSTANDING under `O-6` in `Theorems/Status.lean`; it appears below only as an
explicit hypothesis. -/
def GemmKernelReachesTerminal : Prop :=

        tr.length ≤ (setting seam).problem.maxSteps ∧
        Wasm.observationOfConfig tr f = some o

/-- **How much slack the plan's step bound leaves.**  A Wasm-level bound of
*any* fixed multiple `K ≤ 2 ^ 220` of the plan's static step bound already
implies `Release.GemmKernelReducesBounded`: the plan bound is about `2 ^ 99`
(`GNAF.gemmKernel_stepBound_eq`) and the released budget is `2 ^ 320`.  So what
is missing is the qualitative fact that the compiled loops terminate at all, and
not headroom in the budget — which is why weakening the budget would be the
wrong repair. -/

  **THE HEADLINE OF GO-008.**

  `Universal.SystemEvaluation` at the constructed release setting is inhabited.

  This is what defeats vacuity.  `Release.exists_globalOptimal_of_nonempty` and
  every theorem of `Theorems/Release.lean` quantify over `(seam : Seam)` and are
  gated on nonemptiness of the admissible, *evaluated* set; until now nothing
  inhabited `Seam` at all, so the whole family was an implication with a
  possibly-unsatisfiable antecedent.  It is now an implication about a
  constructed seam whose evaluation type is provably nonempty.

  **What this does not say.**  It does not say the witness bytes are
  `Universal.Admissible`: `Universal.ProfileValid` is proved
  (`Release.witness_profileValid`), but `Universal.SemanticCorrect` — which
  demands `Gemm.Reference.Accepts` at *every* raw invocation — is false for a
  module whose `gemm` returns the constant `0`, and is not claimed here.  The
  nonemptiness antecedent of the release theorem needs admissibility as well as
  evaluation, and that half stays open (`GO-006`, `BI-002`).

/-! `Release.seam_decider_complete_on_witness` and
`Release.globalOptimal_of_witness_semantics` stood here.  Both were stated
against `Release.decider`, the classically chosen evaluator §3 describes and no
longer defines, so both are deleted.  Nothing weaker replaces them: with no
`Universal.Decider` implemented at the release scope there is no
`Universal.GlobalOptimal` statement to make, conditional or otherwise.  The
witness evaluation above survives because it is decider-independent. -/
